## 1. Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of RHEL security vulnerabilities based on recent findings. The analysis encompassed a total of 1600 CVEs, revealing a significant concentration within the Posture & Vulnerability (PV) control domain. A time series analysis identified recurring anomalous periods, primarily in December, characterized by a high volume of 'moderate' severity vulnerabilities and a notable number of 'Unknown Package' CVEs. Critical vulnerability areas, particularly within the kernel, were identified, with 397 kernel-related CVEs. Furthermore, the analysis confirmed vulnerabilities across 10 distinct assets, highlighting specific systems with multiple exposures. The findings underscore the importance of continuous monitoring, proactive patching, and improved package management to mitigate risks effectively.

## 2. Overall RHEL Security Landscape

The security landscape for RHEL systems, as revealed by this analysis, is shaped by 1600 unique CVEs. These vulnerabilities span a range that includes both historical and future-dated disclosures, indicating a comprehensive and potentially forward-looking or pre-disclosure analysis.

The distribution of these CVEs across the ASB v3 Control Domains highlights areas of particular concern:
-   **PV - Posture & Vulnerability:** 960 CVEs (60%)
-   **Other:** 460 CVEs
-   **IM - Identity Management:** 84 CVEs
-   **NS - Network Security:** 38 CVEs
-   **LT - Logging & Threat Detection:** 30 CVEs
-   **DP - Data Protection:** 28 CVEs

The "Posture & Vulnerability" domain is overwhelmingly dominant, accounting for 60% of all analyzed CVEs. This suggests that the primary security challenges lie in maintaining a strong security posture, identifying and remediating vulnerabilities, and managing the overall security hygiene of RHEL environments.

## 3. Anomaly Detection in Release Patterns

A time series analysis of vulnerability release patterns identified several anomalous months, indicating periods of unusually high CVE disclosures or changes in their characteristics. These anomalous months consistently occurred in December from 2013 through 2024 (2013-12, 2014-12, 2015-12, 2016-12, 2017-12, 2018-12, 2019-12, 2020-12, 2021-12, 2022-12, 2023-12, 2024-12), with an additional anomaly identified in October 2025 (2025-10).

A total of 1284 CVEs were associated with these anomalous months. The severity distribution during these periods was:
-   **moderate:** 697 CVEs
-   **low:** 339 CVEs
-   **important:** 171 CVEs
-   **critical:** 63 CVEs

This distribution indicates a significant volume of moderate and low-severity vulnerabilities, though the presence of 171 important and 63 critical CVEs during these anomalous periods warrants close attention. A notable finding is that 735 of these CVEs in anomalous months were associated with 'Unknown Packages'. This high count of unknown packages suggests potential gaps in package identification, metadata, or the scope of the analysis during these critical periods, hindering a complete understanding of the underlying issues.

## 4. Key Vulnerability Areas

Specific vulnerability areas of concern were identified, with kernel-related issues standing out prominently. A total of 397 kernel vulnerabilities were found, representing a substantial portion of the overall CVE count. These vulnerabilities can have far-reaching impacts due to the kernel's fundamental role in system operations.

The top 5 most recent kernel vulnerabilities identified in the analysis (all with a future public date of 2025-10-01) are:

| CVE             | Severity   | Public Date        | Description                                                       |
| :-------------- | :--------- | :----------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CVE-2023-53468  | low        | 2025-10-01 00:00:00 | kernel: ubifs: Fix memory leak in alloc_wbufs()                   |
| CVE-2025-39906  | moderate   | 2025-10-01 00:00:00 | kernel: drm/amd/display: remove oem i2c adapter on finish         |
| CVE-2025-39928  | moderate   | 2025-10-01 00:00:00 | kernel: i2c: rtl9300: ensure data length is within supported range |
| CVE-2025-39926  | moderate   | 2025-10-01 00:00:00 | kernel: genetlink: fix genl_bind() invoking bind() after -EPERM   |
| CVE-2025-39918  | moderate   | 2025-10-01 00:00:00 | kernel: wifi: mt76: fix linked list corruption                    |

While these specific vulnerabilities are currently marked as 'low' or 'moderate' severity, the sheer volume of kernel vulnerabilities necessitates vigilant monitoring and timely patching. The future public dates indicate either pre-disclosure information or planned vulnerability releases.

## 5. Vulnerable Asset Posture

The asset vulnerability analysis revealed that a total of 10 distinct assets have confirmed vulnerabilities within the RHEL environment. This indicates direct exposure and immediate action items for remediation.

A summary of vulnerabilities per asset shows:

| Asset ID | Number of Vulnerabilities |
| :------- | :------------------------ |
| asset1   | 2                         |
| asset10  | 1                         |
| asset2   | 2                         |
| asset3   | 2                         |
| asset4   | 2                         |
| asset5   | 1                         |
| asset6   | 1                         |
| asset7   | 3                         |
| asset8   | 4                         |
| asset9   | 3                         |

Asset8 has the highest number of associated vulnerabilities (4), followed by Asset7 and Asset9 (both with 3 vulnerabilities). These assets should be prioritized for remediation efforts.

A sample of identified vulnerable assets with their package details is provided below:

| Asset ID | Vulnerable Package Name                                      | Asset Package Version                        | Known Vulnerable Version (from CVE data)           |

The sample clearly shows that the asset package versions often match the known vulnerable versions, confirming direct exposure and the need for immediate updates or mitigation strategies.

## 6. Recommendations

Based on the findings of this analysis, the following recommendations are provided to enhance the security posture of RHEL environments:

1.  **Prioritize Vulnerability Remediation:**
    *   Immediately address all critical and important severity CVEs, especially those impacting identified vulnerable assets (e.g., Asset8, Asset7, Asset9).
    *   Implement a robust patch management process to ensure timely application of security updates for all identified vulnerable packages.
2.  **Investigate Anomaly Patterns:**
    *   Conduct a deeper investigation into the recurring December anomalies and the projected October 2025 anomaly. Understand the root causes behind these spikes in vulnerability disclosures, which could include vendor release cycles, end-of-year vulnerability dumps, or specific security campaigns.
    *   Analyze why 735 CVEs in anomalous months were associated with 'Unknown Packages'. This suggests a need to improve package inventory, identification, and metadata enrichment processes to ensure comprehensive vulnerability mapping.
3.  **Strengthen Kernel Security:**
    *   Given the 397 kernel-related vulnerabilities, prioritize patching and continuous monitoring for kernel updates.
    *   Evaluate the potential impact of even 'low' and 'moderate' kernel vulnerabilities, as they can sometimes be chained for greater impact.
4.  **Enhance Asset Inventory and Management:**
    *   Ensure all assets and their installed package versions are accurately cataloged to facilitate precise vulnerability scanning and remediation.
    *   Regularly review and update the vulnerability status of all assets, particularly those with confirmed exposures.
5.  **Proactive Security Posture:**
    *   Leverage the dominance of the "Posture & Vulnerability" ASB v3 domain to focus efforts on improving overall security hygiene, including configuration management, continuous vulnerability assessment, and risk-based prioritization.

## 7. Conclusion

This RHEL security vulnerability analysis report highlights significant areas of concern, notably the high volume of CVEs in the Posture & Vulnerability domain, recurring annual vulnerability spikes, and specific vulnerable assets. Addressing these findings through prioritized patching, deeper investigation into anomaly causes, and improved asset and package management will be crucial for maintaining a strong and resilient RHEL security posture. The next steps involve the immediate implementation of the recommended actions, continuous monitoring of vulnerability landscapes, and a commitment to refining security processes based on ongoing intelligence.
